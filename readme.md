# Tic Tac Toe Multiplayer Game üöÄÔ∏è

This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game with multiplayer functionality, designed as part of my learning journey in React and Node.js. The game uses WebSocket for real-time interaction between players.

## Features

- **Multiplayer Mode**: Connects players in real-time using WebSocket.
- **Random Turn Selection**: The first turn is chosen randomly when the game starts.
- **Player Matching**: Automatically matches players when they log in, or adds them to a waiting list if no opponents are available.
- **React Frontend**: The user interface is built using React.
- **Node.js Backend**: The server is built with Node.js, Express, and WS.

## Installation

### Server Setup

1. Navigate to the `server` folder.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the `frontend` folder.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the frontend:
